## Device paired but Service disappearing in Home.app from time to time

You managed to pair with Accessory or Bridge but after a while it has disappeared?

1. Make sure that device you are using to view Home status is connected to the same network that node-red (with nrchkb) is running on
2. If you are using VLAN or special firewall rules, join us on discord to discuss what settings should be for things to work
