## Which format for msg.payload (JSON)

Payload messages sent and received from the HK node have a **JSON** structure.
To popularize, this structure resembles a library: you search for your book (value) thanks to its title (key).

Below is an example of `msg.payload`:

```js
msg = {
  "payload": {
    "Active": true,
    "StatusActive": true
  }
}
```
In this example we can retrieve the value of `Active` with this message: `msg.payload.Active`.

## Differentiate between passthrough or "from HomeKit" messages

In some cases, it may be useful, even essential, to differentiate a command from the previous node or Home.app in order to avoid a loop problem.
