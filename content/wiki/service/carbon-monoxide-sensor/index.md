## Basic Principle

This is the simplest example of a CO Sensor item. The input nodes are `Detected` and `Not Detected`.

## Example

Below is a list of examples intended to be copied into your Node-RED system and adapted to your setup:

### Full Featured Carbon Monoxide Sensor

This is an example of a carbon monoxide detector that reports the current amount of carbon monoxide in the air as parts per million (PPM). A threshold level of 35 has been set as the "alarm level". This level was chosen because it is the limit of what OSHA has decided is unsafe for 8 hour exposure. Please adjust to the threshold you would like in your system.

There are three inject nodes in this example:

**The `Alarm` inject node** will cause an alarm to trigger in the Home.app. The flow will cause 2 values to be sent to HomeKit immediately, the `CarbonMonoxideLevel` and `{"CarbonMonoxideDetected":1}`. If the new level is higher than the previous peak level (saved in the function as a context variable) then an additional `CarbonMonoxidePeakLevel` message will be sent. The alarm inject button also starts a 1-minute timer before a `{"CarbonMonoxideDetected":0}` message is sent; this message serves to turn off the Home.app alarm.

**The `Non Alarm` inject node** will simply update the `CarbonMonoxideLevel` reported and the `CarbonMonoxidePeakLevel` if it is a new high value since the `Reset` has been pressed. No alarm will be triggered.

**The `Reset` inject node** will send a value of 0 to both `CarbonMonoxideDetected` and `CarbonMonoxidePeakLevel` - used to clear the system after alarms have been dealt with and carbon monoxide sources have been stopped.
