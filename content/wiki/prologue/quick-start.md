This wiki will be used to share examples so that users may see how this plugin functions and get started more easily with copyable flows for each HomeKit service. This page will assume you are familiar with Node-RED basics.

For new users, please start with the [official Node-RED docs](https://nodered.org/docs/) before continuing.

## Demo Setup

Once you have Node-RED running, head over to the Demo Setup page for the easiest demo setup we can provide. This is the setup we use for testing new releases - the demos can be copied directly into Node-RED and added to HomeKit.
