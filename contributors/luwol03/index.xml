This service is meant to be used with a full external irrigation controller which could be some piece of hardware (rachio, skydrop, orbit, etc), it could be an open source setup (OpenSprinkler is good), or it could be simply a set of flows which is controlling your irrigation system. Note that from Home.app it is not possible to make a schedule, it is not possible to enable/disable a schedule, and it is not possible to start a manual schedule.</description></item><item><title>Television</title><link>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/service/television/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2021 18:50:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/service/television/</guid><description>Note: It is recommended that beginners get comfortable with Node Red and more simple HomeKit configurations of this plugin before attempting to set up Television Service.
