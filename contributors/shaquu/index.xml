They can be marked that way for few reasons:
Early adopting and testing, allows us to phase new features. Discovering better ways to solve problems. Easier to test new designs without releasing to public. Important Notice, any experimental feature is subject to change and might be not bug free.
Getting started In order to be able to use experimental features you have to start Node-RED with NRCHKB_EXPERIMENTAL=true environment variable.</description></item><item><title>Credits</title><link>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/discover-more/credits/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/discover-more/credits/</guid><description>This is a place where we would like to thank those who have come before to build the work that we have added to.
History 7 November 2016 Marius Schmeding (@mschm) made the first version of the Node-RED plugin using HAP-NodeJS called node-red-contrib-homekit
13 April 2018 Oliver Rahner (@oliverrahner) steps in and makes a fork called node-red-contrib-homekit-bridged
As Marius Schmeding seems to have abandoned his great work, I decided to fork his repo and to introduce some major rework.</description></item><item><title>FAQ</title><link>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/introduction/faq/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Apr 2021 20:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/introduction/faq/</guid><description>How to update NRCHKB node New version has been released, and you would like to upgrade?

Huge thanks to all contributors and testers from our NRCHKB community! Specially to @crxporter and @kevinkub.

If you are running the Docker way then FFMPEG will be preinstalled for you with several of the options preset (may not have all hardware accelerations built). Alternately you can download and compile your own version of FFMPEG with the build flags you need for your cameras.
For those writing examples, please include how you have installed FFMPEG!
It is recommended to add only one camera per bridge.</description></item></channel></rss>
