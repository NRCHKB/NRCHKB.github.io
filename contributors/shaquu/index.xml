History 7 November 2016 Marius Schmeding (@mschm) made the first version of the Node-RED plugin using HAP-NodeJS called node-red-contrib-homekit
13 April 2018 Oliver Rahner (@oliverrahner) steps in and makes a fork called node-red-contrib-homekit-bridged
As Marius Schmeding seems to have abandoned his great work, I decided to fork his repo and to introduce some major rework.</description></item><item><title>FAQ</title><link>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/introduction/faq/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Apr 2021 20:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/introduction/faq/</guid><description>How to update NRCHKB node New version has been released, and you would like to upgrade?
