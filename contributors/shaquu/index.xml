History 7 November 2016 Marius Schmeding (@mschm) made the first version of the Node-RED plugin using HAP-NodeJS called node-red-contrib-homekit
13 April 2018 Oliver Rahner (@oliverrahner) steps in and makes a fork called node-red-contrib-homekit-bridged
As Marius Schmeding seems to have abandoned his great work, I decided to fork his repo and to introduce some major rework.</description></item><item><title>FAQ</title><link>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/introduction/faq/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Apr 2021 20:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/introduction/faq/</guid><description>Device paired but Service disappearing in Home.app from time to time You managed to pair with Accessory or Bridge but after a while it has disappeared?
Make sure that device you are using to view Home status is connected to the same network that node-red (with nrchkb) is running on If you are using VLAN or special firewall rules, join us on Discord to discuss what settings should be for things to work Type already defined error Type already defined or Cannot register type errors appeared in UI?</description></item><item><title>Switch</title><link>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/service/switch/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2021 18:50:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/service/switch/</guid><description>Switch allow for implementing on/off logic to your devices.
Examples These examples are meant to be copied into your Node-RED system and adapted to your setup.
Simple on/off Switch This is an example of a switch item. The input nodes are &amp;ldquo;On&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Off&amp;rdquo;. The debug node will return values when the switch is turned on or off via the Home app on an Apple device.
