In the past we have tried screenshots, videos, and other ways to show how things work. With this new demo setup, we are taking it to a new level. You can simply copy the code and paste it right into your Node-RED setup to begin playing with many (eventually all) available HomeKit accessories.
Prerequisites You must have Node-RED and node-red-contrib-homekit-bridged (aka &amp;ldquo;our plugin&amp;rdquo;) installed on your system.</description></item><item><title>Contribution</title><link>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/discover-more/contribution/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/discover-more/contribution/</guid><description>Editing Open desired page For example https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/service/lock-mechanism/ Click Edit this page on GitHub

This page will assume you are familiar with Node-RED basics.
For new users, please start with the official Node-RED docs before continuing.
Nodes A Node is the basic building block of a flow. Nodes are triggered by either receiving a message from the previous node in a flow or by waiting for some external event, such as state change of the light or some automated logic.</description></item><item><title>Characteristic Properties</title><link>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/nodes/characteristics/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/nodes/characteristics/</guid><description>What is that A Service node is made up of one or more characteristics. The Characteristic Properties tell the Home.app to adapt its display to the chosen settings. It also allows you to define default values and usage limitations.
üí° The Characteristics available for each service are displayed on each page of the Service section and information about each characteristic in the Characteristic section. How to use it Go to the section called Characteristic Properties of your HomeKit Service Node.</description></item><item><title>Migration</title><link>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/discover-more/migration/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 23:21:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/discover-more/migration/</guid><description>Migration to new setup There are some cases when you may want to move your HomeKit devices to a new Node-RED instance while not changing your Home App pairings. This could be when you are migrating to a new computer, flashing a new SD card for your pi, or restoring from a backup. While not guaranteed, this process should allow migration without needing to remove your bridge or standalone devices from the Home app.</description></item><item><title>Output Messages</title><link>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/nodes/output-messages/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/nodes/output-messages/</guid><description>Which Output to choose? Below is a table with the Output description for the Service Node:
Order Output Description Top onChange Outputs a message only if a value changes, this is the most recommended Output in most cases. Bottom onSet Outputs a message at each set value (even if the value has not changed), it is used to capture repeated inputs like TV remote buttons.</description></item><item><title>Roadmap</title><link>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/discover-more/roadmap/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 21:21:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/discover-more/roadmap/</guid><description>Here is a list of some things that have been accomplished over the last year or so. Also, a few ideas that have been discussed. Please see the issues' area to discuss and make new requests.
Current efforts: Characteristics properties as GUI option in node configuration Add compatibility for custom characteristics (as requested) Explore possibility of 2-way audio for cameras (discussion here) Potential next developments: Add compatibility with Eve Energy (as requested) Add support to manage other homebridged accessories (made outside the node-red?</description></item><item><title>Wait For Setup</title><link>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/nodes/wait-for-setup/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/nodes/wait-for-setup/</guid><description>What is that Wait For Setup feature allows dynamic configuration of the Characteristic Properties of a Service Node before its initialization. In other words, it allows you to configure your Characteristic Properties with values from external sources.
‚ö†Ô∏è Service Node will remain in initialization (will not appear in Home.app) until it has received its configuration message. Once this message has been sent, it cannot be changed unless you redeploy your flow.</description></item><item><title>Experimental</title><link>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/discover-more/experimental/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 23:29:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/discover-more/experimental/</guid><description>During development, we add new features that are marked as experimental.
They can be marked that way for few reasons:
Early adopting and testing, allows us to phase new features. Discovering better ways to solve problems. Easier to test new designs without releasing to public. Important Notice, any experimental feature is subject to change and might be not bug free.
Getting started In order to be able to use experimental features you have to start Node-RED with NRCHKB_EXPERIMENTAL=true environment variable.</description></item><item><title>Credits</title><link>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/discover-more/credits/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/discover-more/credits/</guid><description>This is a place where we would like to thank those who have come before to build the work that we have added to.
History 7 November 2016 Marius Schmeding (@mschm) made the first version of the Node-RED plugin using HAP-NodeJS called node-red-contrib-homekit
13 April 2018 Oliver Rahner (@oliverrahner) steps in and makes a fork called node-red-contrib-homekit-bridged
As Marius Schmeding seems to have abandoned his great work, I decided to fork his repo and to introduce some major rework.</description></item></channel></rss>
