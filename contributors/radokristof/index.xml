This page will assume you are familiar with Node-RED basics.
For new users, please start with the official Node-RED docs before continuing.
Nodes A Node is the basic building block of a flow. Nodes are triggered by either receiving a message from the previous node in a flow or by waiting for some external event, such as state change of the light or some automated logic.</description></item><item><title>Characteristic Properties</title><link>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/nodes/characteristics/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/nodes/characteristics/</guid><description>What is that A Service node is made up of one or more characteristics. The Characteristic Properties tell the Home.app to adapt its display to the chosen settings. It also allows you to define default values and usage limitations.
ðŸ’¡ The Characteristics available for each service are displayed on each page of the Service section and information about each characteristic in the Characteristic section. How to use it Go to the section called Characteristic Properties of your HomeKit Service Node.</description></item><item><title>Security System</title><link>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/service/security-system/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2021 18:50:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/service/security-system/</guid><description>Example This example uses node-red-contrib-alarm as an &amp;ldquo;alarm panel&amp;rdquo;. Many thanks for the devs over there!
The most basic parts are triggers going into alarm nodes and state changes coming to/from HomeKit. I have added in some handling of arming and disarming based on who is home and time of day (automatic arming at night or when we leave home). I am using MQTT for most of my triggers.
Finally, I have an &amp;ldquo;Alarm Noise&amp;rdquo; HomeKit node, this is a StatelessProgrammableSwitch which is set in the Home.</description></item></channel></rss>
