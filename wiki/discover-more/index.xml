Where the Project came from The API work to interact between HomeKit and NodeJS is from HAP-NodeJS.
Marius Schmeding made the first version of the Node-RED plugin to use HAP-NodeJS. His work was later forked by Oliver Rahner who put in a good effort to move over to bridged connections to HomeKit.</description></item></channel></rss>
