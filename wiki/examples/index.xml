To create this I leveraged an ESP8266 based current sensor WemosEM to monitor usage of the Washing Machine. And used the flow to determine if the Washing machine was in use, then trigger a Contact sensor.
The flow watches the watts used, averaging the previous 24 readings, and if they cross 30 watts, trigger the On state, and if the average drops below 15 watts trigger the off state.</description></item><item><title>Demo Setup</title><link>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/examples/demo-setup/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://nrchkb.github.io/wiki/examples/demo-setup/</guid><description>Explanation The nature of this plugin and HomeKit in general is very complex. In the past we have tried screenshots, videos, and other ways to show how things work. With this new demo setup, we are taking it to a new level. You can simply copy the code and paste it right into your Node-RED setup to begin playing with many (eventually all) available HomeKit accessories.
Prerequisites You must have Node-RED and node-red-contrib-homekit-bridged (aka &amp;ldquo;our plugin&amp;rdquo;) installed on your system.</description></item></channel></rss>
